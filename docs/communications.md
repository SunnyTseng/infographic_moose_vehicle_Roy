### Title
- Reducing Moose-Highway Collisions: Decommissioning Roadside Licks

### Introduction

- Roadside mineral licks, formed by winter road salt runoff, lead to moose visitations near highways, contributing to heightened moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs). The research examines the impact of decommissioning roadside mineral licks on reducing moose activity, with a focus on mitigating moose-vehicle collisions. 


### Methods
- We used camera traps to monitor the moose visitation of 22 roadside locations (including roadside licks, roadside ponds, and dry roadsides)

- From December 2009 to July 2020

### Results

1. Seasonal Moose Activity and MVCs:

    - Moose visitation to roadside mineral licks peaks from May to July.
    - This contributes to increased moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs) during summer.

2. Effectiveness of Decommissioning:

    - Decommissioning methods, including materials like riprap, cedar mulch, pine logs, dog fur, and human hair significantly reduce moose visitation to roadside licks.
    - Comparisons with untreated licks, roadside ponds, and dry roadsides highlight the efficacy of these measures.

3. Cost-Effective Motorist Safety:

    - Decommissioning roadside licks is identified as an effective and inexpensive strategy.
    - Implementing these measures enhances motorist safety by reducing encounters with moose near highways.

### Conclusion

- Integrating decommissioning roadside licks into comprehensive mitigation strategies is essential for enhancing highway safety in regions with high moose and motorist densities.
